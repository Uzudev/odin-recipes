    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An incredibly moist, rich, triple-layer, perfect chocolate cake with whipped cream filling and chocolate buttercream frosting.</p> 
    <p>This was always a favorite in our house! You can garnish the cake with sprinkles, chocolate curls, or seasonal fresh fruit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>2 cups boiling water</li>
      <li>2 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place cocoa in a medium bowl. Gently pour boiling water over top and stir to combine; let cool, about 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch round cake pans. </li>
      <li>Sift together flour, baking soda, salt, and baking powder into a mixing bowl. </li>
      <li>Combine sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl; beat with an electric mixer until creamy. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in vanilla. Add flour mixture alternately with the cooled cocoa mixture, mixing only until combined. Pour 1/3 of the cake batter into each of the prepared pans, spreading evenly. </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean and cakes pull away from the sides of the pans, 18 to 22 minutes. Remove cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool for about 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert cakes carefully onto the wire rack and let cool completely, about 20 more minutes. </li>
    </ol>
